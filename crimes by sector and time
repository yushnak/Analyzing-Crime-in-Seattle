"""
This file answers the questions for question 2 of the research problem,
there are ten functions in this file.
This file imports two plugins and reads in the SPD crime data frame.
The ten functions in this file are
get_time_diff, time_diff_crime, time_diff_area, max_time_diff_by_sector_area
min_time_diff_by_sector_area, number_of_crime_per_type,
total_number_of_crimes, crime_by_sector, max_crime_by_sector, and
min_crime_by_sector.
All functions take in the dateframe which is read in the main file.
